#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was strruggling with branching. I was thinking of branching as a totally different concept than what it actually was. I was thinking of it as branches on a tree and that isn't entirely correct. It's more of a separate entity and it a place where the user can work and not bother the other tree while working on this tree. I still don't fully understand, but I will one day. 

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Our guide was extremely helpful with everything. I was able to get more clarity on everything really, from what is actually going on with branches, to knowing a little about my terminal and giving us reall world examples on merge conflicts and how to spot them and get rid of them!

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I didn't exactly as, but as I watched my pair when I was driving I could see how he uses his terminal and realized he knows more git commands than I do. I was able to watch and pick up some cool tricks. My pair and I had a lot of questions for our guide and she was able to explain everything that we asked. I learned .md can't take html and when doing a pull request making sure that we don't merge until someone actually revies the code. That could mess up a big file, I have never had to worry about that because when I am working on my own things I don't really need anyone to review it because its not a huge project that everyone is working on.   

#What still confuses you about git?
Oh, everything probably. I know very little of git and it's inner workings and what everything is actually doing, but I am getting there. I know what a couple of things do and I know it will come with time. As of right now git is a tool that I can use for projects. 

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I had a really good experience with pairing in GPS. My pair was awesome and well spoken person while our guide was hands off, but came in when we were not completely on task. I really enjoyed it.
