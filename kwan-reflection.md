# GPS 1.1 Version Control and Git



### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling with the git branching concept prior to the GPS session. I am kind of knowing what it does, but not fully understand and how to push and pull repo smoothly. Everytime I deal with the merging step I had to look at the cheatsheet I created to check if I did anything wrong before moving to the next step.


### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I get to know more about the git branching idea after the GPS. Not only the discussion with pair helps clarify my thought, but the guide has also provided more insight about how to use branches to prevent messing with the master branch. Also the whole process of add, commit, push, and pull request concept were clarified as well.


### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

My pair and I were both in a state of knowing how to do it but not fully understand it. We asked our guide about a proper way to do push and pull request to github. It helps a lot. And our guide also noticed both of us has a ".git" under our root directory which might lead to a bigger issue in the furture lesson. We had it resolved before starting the session.


### What still confuses you about git?

After the pair session I think I have a better understanding on git branching. However, it becomes very complex when more branches are introduced. Think I should keep on study more about this idea.


### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was a new experience to me. I have never use google hangout for study purpose. It was amazing. However, I think I will make the session will go much smoother if I had go through the assignment content at least once before starting the pair session.
